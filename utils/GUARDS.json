            "description": "The full guard, also known as the closed guard, is one of BJJ’s strongest positions. Full guard is basically an upside-down mount position for the person on the bottom. In full guard, the individual in the bottom position wraps his or her legs around the person on top. From full guard, the bottom player can defend strikes, apply submissions, and initiate sweeps. The full guard is a great BJJ, MMA, and self-defense position. ",

            "description": "What does the deep half guard look like? In the position, you’re lying on your back, your shoulders directly underneath the middle of your opponent’s hips. You control one of their legs, which is extended. By wrapping your own legs around it, most often in a hook configuration or a triangle, and you use your arms to establish grips at the hip level of the same leg.\n\n The other leg of your opponent is bent, and your head rests on the thigh. In certain situations, you can also use one of your arms to control the hip on that side.",

A wide number of sweeps and transitions can be employed from this position while also limiting your opponent's mobility and attacking options.",
