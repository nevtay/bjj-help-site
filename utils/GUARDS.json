            "description": "The full guard, also known as the closed guard, is one of BJJâ€™s strongest positions. Full guard is basically an upside-down mount position for the person on the bottom. In full guard, the individual in the bottom position wraps his or her legs around the person on top. From full guard, the bottom player can defend strikes, apply submissions, and initiate sweeps. The full guard is a great BJJ, MMA, and self-defense position. ",
