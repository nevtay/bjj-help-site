            "description": "The ankle lock (also known as the Achilles lock) is typically the first leg submission taught in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. It is a leg-based attack that targets the Achilles tendon by pressing it towards the foot. It is a fundamentally straightforward submission where you directly apply pressure to the tendon; the pressure is sharp and can cause many opponents to panic if not attended to. As it is a submission, it can cause injury as well if applied on a vulnerable foot.",
