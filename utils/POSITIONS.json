In full guard, the individual in the bottom position wraps his or her legs around the person on top. From full guard, the bottom player can defend strikes, apply submissions, and initiate sweeps. The full guard is a great BJJ, MMA, and self-defense position. ",

It is a variation of the side control position where you line up above the opponent instead of being perpendicular. While in this position, your legs are typically sprawled to maintain pressure and stay mobile. Alternatively, you can drop to your knee to maintain the tightness of the control.",

The main difference from side control, though, is that you will be able to push your opponent’s leg away and stand up while keeping their limbs isolated. This makes it an excellent guard passing position as well as a good way of finishing someone off if they are already hurt or tired.",
